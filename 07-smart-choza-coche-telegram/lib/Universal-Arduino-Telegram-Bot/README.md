#Universal Telegram Bot Library

An Arduino IDE library for using Telegram Bot API. It's designed to be used with multiple Arduino architectures.

Forked from [ESP8266-TelegramBot](https://github.com/Gianbacchio/ESP8266-TelegramBot) & inspired by [TelegramBot-Library](https://github.com/CasaJasmina/TelegramBot-Library)


## Introduction

This library provides an interface for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

Telegram is a instant messaging app that allows for the creation of bots. Bots can be configured to send and receive messages. This is useful for Arduino projects as you can receive updates from your project or issue it commands via your Telegram app.

As mentioned, this is a library forked from [one library](https://github.com/Gianbacchio/ESP8266-TelegramBot) and inspired by [another](https://github.com/CasaJasmina/TelegramBot-Library)

Each library only supported a single type of Arduino and had different features implemented. The only thing that needs to be different for each board is the actual sending of requests to Telegram so I thought a library that additional architectures or boards could be configured easily would be useful, although this springs to mind:

## Installing

The downloaded code can be included as a new library into the IDE selecting the menu:

     Sketch / include Library / Add .Zip library

You also have to install the ArduinoJson library written by [Beno√Æt Blanchon](https://github.com/bblanchon). Search for it on the Arduino Library manager or get it from [here](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson).

Include UniversalTelegramBot in your project:

    #include <UniversalTelegramBot.h>

and pass it a Bot token and a SSL Client (See the examples for more details)

    #define BOTtoken "XXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    // WiFiSSLClient client; //For 101 boards
    WiFiClientSecure client; //For ESP8266 boards
    UniversalTelegramBot bot(BOTtoken, client);

*NOTE:* This library has not been tested with the 101 boards as I do not have a compatible board. If you can help please let me know!

## Getting started

View the last released Telegram API documentation at: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api.

To generate your new Bot, you need an Access Token. Talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow a few simple steps described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

For full details, see "[Bots: An introduction for developers](https://core.telegram.org/bots)".

## --- API ---

These are the main functions of the library

#### sendMessage

    bool sendMessage(String chat_id, String text, String parse_mode);

Send a message to the specified chat_id. parse_mode can be left blank. Will return true if the message sends successfully.

#### sendMessageWithReplyKeyboard

    bool sendMessageWithReplyKeyboard(String chat_id, String text,
      String parse_mode, String keyboard, bool resize = false,
      bool oneTime = false, bool selective = false);

Send a keyboard to the specified chat_id. parse_mode can be left blank. Will return true if the message sends successfully. See the CustomKeyboard example for more details.

#### getUpdates

    int getUpdates(long offset);

Gets any pending messages from Telegram and stores them in bot.messages . Offset should be set to bot.last_message_recived + 1. Returns the numbers new messages received. See any of the examples for recommended usage.


## Examples

Here are listed some examples to help you to build your own Bot:

- EchoBot : replies echoing your messages.

- FlashLedBot : Reacts to your command switching ON/OFF a GPIO.

- CustomKeyboard : Same as FlashLedBot but also uses a replyKeyboard
